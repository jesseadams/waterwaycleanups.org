## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the Hugo development server with asset watching
- `npm run build` - Build the Hugo site for production
- `npm run build:assets` - Build frontend assets with Webpack
- `npm run watch:assets` - Watch and rebuild frontend assets during development
- `npm run minify:css` - Minify standalone CSS files not processed by Webpack
- `npm run clean` - Clean generated assets (CSS and JS bundle files)
- `npm run serve` - Run the Hugo server in production mode
- `npm run start` - Build assets and start Hugo server in production mode

### Recommended Development Workflow

For the most efficient development experience that watches all file changes (content, layouts, CSS, JavaScript, and React components):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This single command will:
- Start the Hugo development server with live reload
- Watch and rebuild frontend assets when changed
- Update the browser automatically when any files are modified

### Working with React Components

This project includes React components for interactive elements like the parallax image effect and date displays.

1. Make changes to React components in the `static/js/react-components/` directory

2. Build the React components:
   ```bash
   npm run build:assets
   ```
   This runs webpack to bundle the React components into JS files that Hugo can use

3. For automatic rebuilding during development:
   ```bash
   npm run watch:assets
   ```
   This will rebuild components whenever you save changes

### CSS Processing

The project uses multiple CSS processing pipelines:

1. **Tailwind CSS** - Processed through Webpack and PostCSS
   - Source: `static/css/src/tailwind.css`
   - Output: `static/css/tailwind-output.css` and `static/css/tailwind-output.min.css` (production)

2. **Standalone CSS** - Various CSS files that may need separate minification
   - Main standalone style: `static/css/style.css` ‚Üí `static/css/style.min.css` 
   - To minify: `npm run minify:css`

3. **Component-specific CSS** - Various CSS files like `bricks.css`, `header-footer.css`, etc.

## üìù Content Tips

When creating new pages or editing existing content, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Structured Markdown**: Use proper markdown heading hierarchy (# for main title, ## for sections, etc.)

2. **Images**: All images should be placed in the `/static/uploads/` directory, organized in subfolders for better management

3. **Shortcodes**: Utilize the available brick shortcodes to maintain consistent styling across the site

4. **Front Matter**: Each content file should include the appropriate front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Page Title"
   date: 2023-10-15
   draft: false
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   image: "/uploads/feature-image.jpg"
   ---
   ```

5. **Events**: When creating event pages, include the following front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Event Title"
   date: 2023-10-15
   draft: false
   tags: ["location", "event-type"]
   image: "/uploads/event-image.jpg"
   start_time: "2023-10-15T09:00:00-07:00"
   end_time: "2023-10-15T12:00:00-07:00"
   location: "Beach Name, City, State"
   ---
   ```

6. **Brick Composition**: Combine multiple bricks to create engaging, visually appealing pages

## üö¢ Deployment

### Local Production Build

To build the site for production locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
1. Cleans previous build artifacts
2. Builds Tailwind CSS with minification
3. Builds frontend assets with Webpack in production mode
4. Minifies standalone CSS files
5. Sets HUGO_ENV to production
6. Builds the Hugo site with minification

The built site will be in the `public/` directory, ready for deployment.

### Testing Production Build Locally

To test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This runs the Hugo server with the production environment settings.

### Continuous Integration/Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow:

1. Builds on every push to main and pull request
2. Automatically deploys to AWS S3 and invalidates CloudFront cache when merged to main
3. Runs a daily scheduled build to ensure content is up-to-date

The deployment process:
1. Cleans build artifacts
2. Builds frontend assets with webpack
3. Minifies standalone CSS files
4. Builds the Hugo site with minification
5. Deploys to S3 and invalidates CloudFront

## üé® Customization

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling. You can customize the design by:

1. Editing the `tailwind.config.js` file to modify colors, fonts, and other design tokens
2. Adding custom CSS in the `static/css/src/` directory
3. Rebuilding CSS with `npm run build:css`

For more information on Tailwind CSS utility classes and configuration options, refer to the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Hugo Configuration

The main Hugo configuration is in `config.yaml`. You can modify:
- Site title and description
- Menu items
- Social media links
- Other site-wide settings
