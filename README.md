## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the Hugo development server with asset watching
- `npm run build` - Build the Hugo site for production
- `npm run build:assets` - Build frontend assets with Webpack
- `npm run watch:assets` - Watch and rebuild frontend assets during development
- `npm run build:css` - Build and minify Tailwind CSS
- `npm run watch:css` - Watch and rebuild Tailwind CSS during development
- `npm run start` - Build assets and start Hugo server
- `npm run clean` - Clean generated assets

### Recommended Development Workflow

For the most efficient development experience that watches all file changes (content, layouts, CSS, JavaScript, and React components):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This single command will:
- Start the Hugo development server with live reload
- Watch and rebuild frontend assets when changed
- Update the browser automatically when any files are modified

### Working with React Components

This project includes React components for interactive elements like the parallax image effect and date displays.

1. Make changes to React components in the `static/js/react-components/` directory

2. Build the React components:
   ```bash
   npm run build:assets
   ```
   This runs webpack to bundle the React components into JS files that Hugo can use

3. For automatic rebuilding during development:
   ```bash
   npm run watch:assets
   ```
   This will rebuild components whenever you save changes

### Homepage (`content/en/_index.md`)
