## Event Details

Join us and River Rock Outfitter for our first cleanup from the water! This summer cleanup is critical for maintaining the health of our local waterways and protecting wildlife habitats. Volunteers will work together to remove trash and debris from the water and shoreline. Bring your kayak or canoe and help us remove as much trash as we can from the shore and water that would normally not be otherwise accessible. 

Dress in cool, comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes. Bring water, sunscreen, and a hat for sun protection.
