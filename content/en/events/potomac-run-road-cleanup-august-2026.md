## Event Details

Join us for our first Potomac Run Road cleanup of the year! This is a busy road so younger kids are not allowed to participate for safety reasons. This location is a key location that intersects with Potomac Creek. A lot of vehicles transporting trash to the landfill don't adeqately secure their loads. As a result, a lot of trash blows out and onto the roadside.
