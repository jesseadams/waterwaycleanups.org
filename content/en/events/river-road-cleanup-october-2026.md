## Event Details

Join us for a community cleanup day along River Road! Let's work together to protect our waterways and keep our community clean. We advise no young kids for this cleanup as it is along a roadway but ultimately it is up to the parent's discretion.

Please wear clothes and shoes you don't mind potentially getting dirty and bring water!
