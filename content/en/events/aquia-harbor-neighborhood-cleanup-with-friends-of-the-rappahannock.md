## Event Details

Join FOR, Stafford County and the Green Aquia Initiative in helping cleanup the Aquia Harbor on April 26th! Volunteers will meet at Briar Patch Park (21B 1269, Stafford, VA 22554), where there is plenty of parking. Gloves, trash bags and litter grabbers will be provided.

There will be an on water cleanup option for those who bring their own kayaks and life jackets.

Please wear clothes you donâ€™t mind getting dirty and shoes with ankle support for your safety. People of all ages are welcome, but we will only allow willing adults along roadways. Whether you are doing on-water or on-land pickup, each volunteer will need to sign a waiver for both FOR and the Green Aquia Initiative.
