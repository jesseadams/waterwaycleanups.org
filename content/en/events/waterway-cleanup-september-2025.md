## Event Details

Join us for our September waterway cleanup as we transition into fall! This is a perfect opportunity to help prepare our waterways for the changing seasons. Together, we'll remove accumulated summer debris and trash to ensure our local waterways remain healthy.

Wear weather-appropriate clothing and sturdy shoes. The early fall weather can be variable, so dress in layers.
