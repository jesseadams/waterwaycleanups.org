## Event Details

Join us for our September waterway cleanup as we transition into fall! This is a perfect opportunity to help prepare our waterways for the changing seasons. Together, we'll remove accumulated summer debris and trash to ensure our local waterways remain healthy.

Please dress in cool, comfortable clothing and water-friendly shoes. Bring lots of water, sunscreen, and a hat for sun protection. If you have a kayak please bring it with you! PFDs are required. A limited number of kayaks are available to borrow (email info@waterwaycleanups.org to claim). A staff member will do a water safety briefing prior to our group launching.
