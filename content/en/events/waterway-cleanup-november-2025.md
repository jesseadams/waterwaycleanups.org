## Event Details

Join us for our November waterway cleanup! As we approach the end of fall, it's important to remove debris before winter weather sets in. This cleanup helps prevent trash from being washed into our waterways during winter storms and protects our local ecosystem.

Please dress warmly in layers as November weather can be chilly. Waterproof boots are recommended as shorelines may be muddy.
