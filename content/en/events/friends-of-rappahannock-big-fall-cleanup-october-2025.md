## Event Details

Join us for the annual Friends of the Rappahannock Big Fall Cleanup! This large-scale cleanup event brings together volunteers from across the region to help remove trash and debris from the Rappahannock River and its tributaries before winter.

Fall is a critical time to clean our waterways before seasonal rains and winter weather can wash accumulated debris downstream. Your participation helps protect water quality and wildlife habitat throughout the Rappahannock watershed.

Dress warmly in layers and wear sturdy, waterproof footwear. Gloves and equipment will be provided.
