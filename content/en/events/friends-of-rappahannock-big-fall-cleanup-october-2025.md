## Event Details

### [Friend's of the Rappahannock's](https://riverfriends.org) Annual Big Fall Cleanup is back and we’re excited to get our river and community ready for the fall!

Join us with Friends of the Rappahannock on Oct 18th at Old Mill Park for a morning of litter cleanup and enjoying the Rappahannock. Volunteers/groups will meet at Old Mill Park and then disperse to their assigned cleanup sites (all of which are a less than a 10min walk or drive from Old Mill), after some FREE breakfast and coffee by the river!<br/>

Make sure to wear good walking shoes and clothes you don’t mind potentially getting dirty. Volunteers under 16 years old need to have a guardian/group leader present.
