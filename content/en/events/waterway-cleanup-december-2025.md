## Event Details

Join us for our final waterway cleanup of 2025! Help us close out the year by giving our local waterways some much-needed care before winter fully sets in. This is a great opportunity to make a positive environmental impact before the holiday season.

Come prepared for cold weather with warm layers, waterproof gloves, and sturdy boots. Hot beverages will be provided to keep volunteers warm.
