## Event Details

Join us for our final waterway cleanup of 2025! Help us close out the year by giving our local waterways some much-needed care before winter fully sets in. This is a great opportunity to make a positive environmental impact before the Christmas and the New Year! Please come prepared for cold weather with warm layers, glove liners, and sturdy shoes/boots that are able to get muddy. Hot beverages will be provided to keep volunteers warm. This is a busy road so younger kids are not allowed to participate for safety reasons.

This location is a key location that intersects with Potomac Creek. A lot of vehicles transporting trash to the landfill don't adeqately secure their loads. As a result, a lot of trash blows out and onto the roadside.
