## Repurposed Rain Barrels: Upcycling for Cleaner Waterways

{{< badges "Waste Prevention, Upcycling, Runoff Management, Pollution Mitigation" >}}

As part of our mission to prevent waste, manage stormwater runoff, and protect local ecosystems, Waterways Cleanup is transforming used food storage barrels into fully functional rain barrels. This initiative reduces pollution, prevents erosion, and promotes water conservation—while giving everyday residents a hands-on way to protect Virginia's rivers and streams.

Rain barrels work by capturing and storing rainwater from rooftops that would otherwise rush over driveways and pavement, picking up pollutants like oil, pesticides, and trash. Without intervention, this runoff flows directly into storm drains and nearby waterways, degrading water quality and aquatic habitats. By reducing both the volume and speed of stormwater, rain barrels help:

- Prevent erosion along stream banks,
- Keep sediment and pollutants out of creeks and rivers,
- Reduce strain on combined sewer systems, which can overflow and release untreated sewage during heavy rains, and
- Lower household water use by providing an alternative source for watering gardens, lawns, and landscapes.

Each upcycled barrel includes:

- A solid spigot with garden hose attachment
- An overflow fitting with garden hose attachment
- A 3D-printed 4" hose to 2" bung adapter
- A gutter downspout to 4" hose connector

Made from reclaimed food-grade containers, these rain barrels extend the life of materials that might otherwise become waste. Beyond their function, they stand as visible reminders of grassroots environmental action — sparking conversations and inspiring neighbors to consider their role in protecting local waterways. Every barrel installed is not just a tool — it's a step toward a cleaner, more resilient community.

## Our Trash-Free Waters: Summer Challenge 2025

{{< badges "Waterway Cleanups, Pollution Mitigation, Awareness" >}}

The <strong>Trash-Free Waters Summer Challenge</strong> will remove hundreds of pounds of trash and debris, preventing plastics, metals, and other pollutants from entering sensitive ecosystems. Beyond immediate impact, the program will raise awareness about litter prevention, conservation, and personal responsibility in protecting water resources. By hosting recurring cleanups, we will foster lasting habits of civic environmental engagement and create visible improvements in high-impact local areas.

Grant funding will be used to purchase durable safety equipment, cleanup tools, signage, and to help acquire a trailer to safely transport supplies to multiple cleanup sites. Having a dedicated trailer will allow Waterway Cleanups, Inc. to increase its reach, respond to community cleanup requests, and manage events more effectively.

Through this program, we aim not only to clean our waters but to inspire a movement—uniting neighbors, families, and community partners in a shared vision for a cleaner, healthier Virginia.

## City of Fredericksburg Park Steward Program - Wetlands in Dixon Park

{{< badges "Waterway Cleanups, Pollution Mitigation, Awareness, Wildlife Protection" >}}

![](/uploads/waterway-cleanups/fredericksburg-va-park-steward-program-wetlands-in-dixcon-park-waterway-cleanups-virginia.jpg)

This is Waterway Cleanups's inaugural seasonal program dedicated to reducing pollution in Stafford County, Virginia's rivers, streams, and creeks. 

Focused on <strong>Rappahannock River, Potomac River, and Aquia Creek</strong>, this project will engage local volunteers in hands-on cleanups during the peak summer months. Our goal is to host at least one organized cleanup event per month <strong>from June through September 2025</strong>, empowering community members to take direct action to protect our waterways.

<strong>We believe environmental stewardship should be accessible to all</strong>. To remove financial barriers and make volunteering safe and welcoming, we provide free safety gear, trash collection supplies, and logistical support at every event. Volunteers are asked to contribute only their time and passion. Events will be publicized widely to engage residents from diverse backgrounds and build a stronger, more connected community around the shared goal of healthy waterways.

## Building Trust Through Action

Waterway Cleanups will track key measurable results to demonstrate the success and impact of the Trash-Free Waters: Summer Challenge 2025 program.

---

### Building a Foundation

As a brand-new nonprofit organization founded in 2025, we are focused on establishing our credibility and building strong community participation from the ground up. For our first summer series, we expect to engage a minimum of 5 volunteers per cleanup event, for a total of at least 20 volunteers across all events. We will also track volunteer hours, with a goal of a minimum of 60 hours contributed over the season.

---

### Trash Removal

Each event will measure the number of bags of trash collected, with a goal of removing a minimum of 60 bags of litter and debris from our local waterways and surrounding environments. We will also estimate the weight of trash removed, aiming for a minimum of 1,200 pounds of material collected over the course of the project.

---

### Tracking Our Impact

Volunteer participation numbers, hours contributed, bags collected, and pounds of debris removed will all be recorded using a standardized event tracking form. In addition, we will capture before and after photos at cleanup sites to visually demonstrate the environmental improvements achieved through the program.
