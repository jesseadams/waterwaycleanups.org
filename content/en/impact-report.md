## A Message from Our President

This year marks a historic milestone for Waterway Cleanups. What started as a vision to protect and restore Virginia's precious waterways has grown into a thriving community of environmental stewards.

The numbers speak for themselves, but behind each statistic is a story of dedication, community spirit, and genuine care for our environment. Every volunteer who showed up, every bag of trash collected, and every hour spent cleaning represents our collective commitment to leaving our waterways better than we found them.

As we look toward 2026, we're inspired by what we've accomplished and energized by the potential for even greater impact. Thank you to every volunteer, partner, and supporter who made this incredible first year possible.

## Looking Forward

Our first year has laid a strong foundation for the future. With your continued support, we're planning to expand our reach, engage more volunteers, and make an even greater impact on Virginia's waterways in 2026. We have large goals to expand our mission space into growing native plants and using them to solve erosion, stormwater management, and pollution challenges in our community. We need volunteers now more than ever. Please join our mailing list today!

## Thank You

To our incredible volunteers, generous sponsors, and community partners - this impact report represents the power of collective action. Together, we're not just cleaning waterways; we're building a movement for environmental stewardship that will benefit generations to come. We have our entire schedule for 2026 cleanup events on the calendar already. We will also be adding dates around the native plant nursery soon.
