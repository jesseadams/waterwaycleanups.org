## A Message from Our President

This year marks a historic milestone for Waterway Cleanups. What started as a vision to protect and restore Virginia's precious waterways has grown into a thriving community of environmental stewards.

The numbers speak for themselves, but behind each statistic is a story of dedication, community spirit, and genuine care for our environment. Every volunteer who showed up, every bag of trash collected, and every hour spent cleaning represents our collective commitment to leaving our waterways better than we found them.

As we look toward 2026, we're inspired by what we've accomplished and energized by the potential for even greater impact. Thank you to every volunteer, partner, and supporter who made this incredible first year possible.

## Recognition

Our achievements this year wouldn't have been possible without the incredible dedication of our volunteers and the support of our community partners. Each cleanup event brought together people from all walks of life, united by a common goal of protecting our precious waterways.
